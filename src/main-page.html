<h1>Hi there 👋</h1>
<p>
    I'm Andreia, a self-taught developer on a journey from recruitment to software development, driven by a passion for problem-solving and technology.
</p>
<p>
    🧠 I graduated in Psychology from the University of Minho and I have 4 years of experience working in recruitment. I'm a people person and thrive the most working in a fast-paced and multicultural environment. As a recruiter, I have gained experience in project management, mentoring team members, and implementing efficient processes. My time in recruitment exposed me to diverse tech roles, sparking my curiosity about programming and technology.
</p>
<p>
    🖥️ Currently, I'm developing my skills through an intensive full-stack Bootcamp with Code for All_, Academia de Código, specializing in Java and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    🌱 My tech stack includes Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Git, JUnit, Mockito, and Maven. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to broaden my expertise.
